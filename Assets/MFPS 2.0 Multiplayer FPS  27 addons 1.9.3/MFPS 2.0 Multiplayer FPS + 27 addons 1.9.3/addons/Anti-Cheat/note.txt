**For MFPS 1.9.2 or later**

This addon comes with advanced integration of the Anti-Cheat Toolkit (ACTk) system and a custom Player Report system which increases the security of your game.

With the advanced integration of the Anti-Cheat system, players detected using Speedhack, Code Injection, Memory Injection, or Wallhack will be automatically banned and kicked out of the game.

With the custom Player Report system, you allow the players to manually submit reports of suspected hackers/cheaters in the game by simply clicking over the player name in the player scoreboard > selecting the Report option > and submitting the report. You or your game moderators can manage the player reports and take the appropriate actions for each case in the Admin Panel (ULogin Pro).

The add-on comes with 3-step automated integration (no code required).

This add-on requires Anti-Cheat Toolkit (ACTk) and ULogin Pro to enable all the features.
